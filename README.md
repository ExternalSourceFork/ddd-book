## Running the infrastructure

For some chapters, you need to have the necessary infrastructure components, like database, running locally. The suggested way of doing this is using Docker and Docker Compose. 

Each chapter has the _Technical Requirelements_ section, please follow the guidelines carefully to ensure you run what is needed for each chapter _before_ starting the application.
